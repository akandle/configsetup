#TODO

## July 19 2020
- create folders for the areas of the app in models, controllers, routers, etc
- totally broken at the moment.  Need to rewrite everything, as it turns out
- that babel is 100% unnecessary to use the tools I have been using, so possibly
- not only will complexity be reduced, but it wont be so god dammed buggy.

## Misc
- Naming convention
    - Sub-Files/Folders
    - Root folders/Project naming
    - Domain naming setup, make it easier to use and will enable IPv6 support without brain melting

- Move initial setups into their own sections and files
